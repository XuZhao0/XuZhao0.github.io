ðŸ‘‹ I am James Zhao, a first year PhD student of [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg). Before that, I obtained master degree from NUS, advised by [Prof. Michael Shieh](https://michaelshieh.com) and bachelor degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

I am interested in NLP, particularly topics related to Large Language Models. Currently, I am passionate about enhancing the reasoning capabilities of these models. I always welcome collaborations and discussions about these topics. If you're interested, please do not hesitate to reach out to discuss more ðŸ˜ƒ
