ðŸ‘‹ I am a Master student (2022 - present) of [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg) advised by [Prof. Michael Qizhe Xie](https://www.michaelxie.com). Before that, I obtained my bachelor degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China in 2022.

I am interested in NLP, particularly topics related to Large Language Models. Currently, I am passionate about enhancing the reasoning capabilities of these models. My aspiration is to develop effiecient and faithful reasoning methods. Besides, I am also interested in the evaluation of LLMs to judge their helpfulness, honest, harmless. 

I always welcome collaborations and discussions about these topics. If you're interested, please do not hesitate to reach out to discuss moreðŸ˜ƒ
