ðŸ‘‹ I am James Zhao, a second year PhD candidate of [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg) at [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg). I am co-advised by [Prof. Bryan Hooi](https://bhooi.github.io) and [Prof. See-Kiong Ng](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~ngsk/). Before that, I obtained master's degree and bachelor's degree from NUS and UESTC respectively.

I am interested in trustworthiness and LLM reasoning. I always welcome collaborations and discussions about these topics. If you're interested, please do not hesitate to reach out to discuss more ðŸ˜ƒ
